IMPORTANT FOR LATER: In the accessories page, Dr wants me to make the accessories pressable so the customer can observe the item and its pics and details (color, weight, can endure what weight, etc..).

1. Finance page for the admins
2. SUBMITTING A REVIEW IS NOT SENDING IT TO THE DATABASE PLEASE CHECK.

NOTE: When an event is for example is in today's date, and today is already here, the event status doesn't change to past/completed. So admin should do it manually.

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master

I was thinking about making an event's status "cancelled" or mark it as "past" event if the date of the event came already and the admins didn't respond to it.
