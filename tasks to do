I want to do these following tasks for me:

1. user-details.php (in "view user's events", all events time is 12:00Am, so add a field for the reservations which is what hour they want their event. NOTE that events start early at 12pm and start late at 9pm).

IMPORTANT FOR LATER: In the accessories page, Dr wants me to make the accessories pressable so the customer can observe the item and its pics and details (color, weight, can endure what weight, etc..).

{
IMPORTANT: create pages in admin panel:

1. Finance page

IMPORTANT: create pages in user website:

1. edit-event.php in the dashboard section (user edits his event before it gets approved)
   }

{
ADDITIONAL STUFF TO DO IN FREE TIME

1. SUBMITTING A REVIEW IS NOT SENDING IT TO THE DATABASE PLEASE CHECK.
2. is there anyway that the "contact organizer" message is shown in the admin panel and not only in the database?
   }

NOTE: When an event is for example is in today's date, and today is already here, the event status doesn't change to past/completed. So admin should do it manually.

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master
