I want to do these following tasks for me:

1. I want to replace the 'Login / Sign up' nav element in every page if the user is already logged in.
2. user-details.php (in "view user's events", all events time is 12:00Am, so add a field for the reservations which is what hour they want their event. NOTE that events start early at 12pm and start late at 9pm).

IMPORTANT FOR LATER: In the accessories page, Dr wants me to make the accessories pressable so the customer can observe the item and its pics and details (color, weight, can endure what weight, etc..).

{
IMPORTANT: create pages in admin panel:

1. edit-admin.php
2. OPTIONAL: delete-user.php (if i want an admin to delete a user's account. NOTE that the Dr wants me to "block" a user, not delete, so we can still access his data of reservations).
3. Make a page for the admins activity logs, that only the super admin can see, also make them appear from the latest to the newest since the logs are too many.

IMPORTANT: create pages in user website:

1. edit-event.php in the dashboard section (user edits his event before it gets approved)
2. Later on: A notifications page that the user can see for example if an admin cancels his event (show the message).
   or if the event becomes past/completed event (show a message that the event is completed)
   }

ADDITIONAL STUFF TO DO IN FREE TIME

1. SUBMITTING A REVIEW IS NOT SENDING IT TO THE DATABASE PLEASE CHECK.
2. is there anyway that the "contact organizer" message is shown in the admin panel and not only in the database?
3. The "Venue" field when empty is returning 0 value instead of Null, even tho its varchar, please check it.
   }

NOTE: When an event is for example is in today's date, and today is already here, the event status doesn't change to past/completed. So admin should do it manually.

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master
