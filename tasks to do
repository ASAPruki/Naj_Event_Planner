IMPORTANT: in the upcoming section in the user dashboard, I want only the confirmed events to be displayed
Work on exporting the financial page as excel, pdf, etc...

If i have time, try to let the admin to delete certain pics of a certain accessory in the "edit-accessory" page.

Note that a user can't pay the receipts if the event becomes "past"

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master

Run the localhost query to check the statuses of the 2 events:
1st one was pending and the 2nd was confirmed
both dates are 5/11/2025
this is the query: select all from reservations where user_id = 1 and event_date = "2025-05-11"
Also the events were: 4 upcoming, 1 pending, and 12 past events
And total of financial records: 16
