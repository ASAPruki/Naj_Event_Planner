1. Finance page for the admins

I was thinking about making an event's status "cancelled" or mark it as "past" event if the date of the event came already and the admins didn't respond to it.

Add facebook and twitter links if there are.

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master
