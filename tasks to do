1. Finance page for the admins

IMPORTANT: in the upcoming section in the user dashboard, I want only the confirmed events to be displayed

I was thinking about making an event's status "cancelled" or mark it as "past" event if the date of the event came already and the admins didn't respond to it.

If i have time, try to permit the admin to delete certain pics of a certain accessory in the "edit-accessory" page.

Add facebook and twitter links if there are.

to push to github:

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push -u origin master
